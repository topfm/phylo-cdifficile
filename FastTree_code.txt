#Sequence assembly and Timetree creation of C. difficile isolates downloaded from He et al., 2013. 

#To start, I had raw fastq illumina paired end reads for 127 C. difficile genomes. They were labeled by accession. I made a .txt file called accessions.txt which is just a list of the labels of the fastq files. The rough label would be "Accession_1.fastq" for read 1 and "Accession_2.fastq" for read 2. 
#I also have the c.difficile reference whole genome, which is R20291.fasta and is used for the reference guided assembly.

#1. Assemble the fastq files. I put all fastqs in one directory. Using Pepperell lab RGA pipleine that is included on the GitHub repository. 

home/mtopf/temp-mtopf/all_He_data/assemblies$ while read f; do ../../../../../home/myoungblom/scripts/scripts/RGAPepPipe.sh $f ../../../../../opt/data/cdiff/R20291.fasta; done < He_accessions.txt

#this assembly takes a while, a few days. But at the end the output is many _pilon.fasta files!
#now we have fasta files. I concatenate all of them into one input to make the tree out of.

home/mtopf/temp-mtopf/all_He_data/assemblies$ cat *.fasta > input.fasta
home/mtopf/temp-mtopf/all_He_data/assemblies$ vim input.fasta
#remove the weird labels of the headers that have pilon and the information about the reference genome (also called FN4816.1//g)
:%s/_pilon//g
:%s/pilon_//g
:%s/RGA_to_FN545816.1//g
:%s/Clostridium difficile R20291 complete genome//g

#make a tree using Fasttree version 2.1.9. Parameter choice described in final report. Output tree will be called tree.out.

home/mtopf/temp-mtopf/all_He_data/assemblies$ /opt/PepPrograms/FastTree-2.1.9 -nt -gamma -slow -boot 100 input.fasta > tree.out

#use dendroscope to convert fasttree to newick format.
#to do this, I have to re-ssh into the server using -X which allows use of Dendroscope format 
ssh -X mtopf@basebyte
mtopf@basebyte:/home/mtopf$ opt/PepPrograms/dendroscope/Dendroscope
#open the output fasttree called tree.out; export as .newick

#head to R to visualize! save everything on computer.
